OurSQL
========

OurSQl is a small single user database management system implemented in C++.
The grammar of OurSQL is almost the same with MySQL.
It supports B+ tree index, not null constraint, primary key constraint,
foreign key constraint, check constraint, aggregate functions, 
group by statement, multi-table inner join and 
ECMAScript regular expressions match.

No platform-related library is used in this project. So it's totally portable.
